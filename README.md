### Hi there, I'm Jeffrey Girard! 

I'm an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Psychology][kupsych] at the [University of Kansas][ku]. I work in clinical psychology and explore the links between mental health, affect, and interpersonal functioning. I collaborate with computer scientists and clinicians to develop technologies that support clinical practice. I use observational methods to quantify facial expressions and other behavioral signals. My main goal is to understand the role that behavioral signals play in emotion and interpersonal communication. I use data science techniques from statistics, machine learning, and software engineering to address research challenges. I love to develop, share, and teach about tools that increase scientific rigor and openness.

- [mReliability][mreliability] - This is a stable (but approaching end-of-life) set of MATLAB functions for estimating inter-rater reliability.
- [wcc][wcc] - This is an experimental R package for conducting windowed cross-correlation analyses.
- [varde][varde] - This is an experimental R package for decomposing the variance in mixed effects models.
- [agreement][agreement] - This is an experimental R package for estimating inter-rater reliability.

## Research Software:
- [CARMA][carma] - This is a stable (but approaching end-of-life) software for collecting continuous media annotations.
- [DARMA][darma] - This is a stable (but approaching end-of-life) software for collecting continuous two-dimensional media annotations.
- [tidymedia][tidymedia] - This is an experimental R package for working with audio, video, and image files.
- [openac][openac] - This is an experimental R package for automating common affective computing (and social signal processing) tasks.
